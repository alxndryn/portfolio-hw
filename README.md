## The Repository

This repository holds the code for my personal portfolio website.

## Portfolio

This project is being made to showcase my work as a Web Developer to potential employers. It has given me practice in HTML and CSS. With this website I have reached a greater understanding of how to make the layout of a page look exactly how I want it to. The website includes:

* About Me - A concise insight towards my interests

* Portfolio - Links the projects I am most proud of

* Contact - For potential employers or clients to contact me
