    <p>I am currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin. After taking an online course on the subject, I became eager to be among other aspiring Web Developers in a fast-paced and challenging environment. I have a newfound passion for the latest technologies used in making interactive and engaging websites. I am eager to increase my knowledge through personal study and professional work.</p>
    <p>Through online studies and the coding bootcamp I am currently attending, I have made several personal websites showcasing my skills with HTML5 and CSS as well as a few flash animation games with Javascript. I was able to successfully build these projects with relentless trial and error and a passion for learning. There is a lot of satisfaction in getting my project to look and work the way I want it to and that will always make the process of getting there well worth it.</p>
    <p>I am currently looking for a new career in Web Development. I would love to be apart of making your website visually appealing and engaging to your customers.</p>
